### Hi there 

I'm Allen, a 1A Computer Engineering Student at the University of Waterloo. 

I have a ton of interests, and I would be lying if I said I always knew what I wanted to do in the future. 

I've always been interested in Software, Hardware, Technology, Business, Management, Sports, History, and much more. 

However, in May 2023, I decided to pursue Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo, one of North America's top technology schools.


I am currently a Firmware Developer for Waterloo's Formula Electric Design Team: https://github.com/UWaterloo-Formula-Electric 

I have done a few projects recently, including: 
- A movie project using Vue, JS, HTML/CSS, Axios, and Postman, integrating data from the TMDB API. 
- Python games using Pygame and Python 
- A Fall Detection Device for the elderly, using a STM32, C/C++, an Accelerometer, and a GSM Module 

And I am currently working on a Wildlife and Plant Detector, which will use Python, CVAT, PyTorch, Vite.js, React.js, TypeScript, HTML/CSS, React Native

I am also working on getting my own website up and running, which will be a  place to showcase my projects, post helpful resources and tips I have/I've gotten, and a place to blog about my interests and life.
