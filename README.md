# Hi there :)

## About me 
I'm Allen, a first year Computer Engineering Student at the University of Waterloo. :school:<br>
I've always had a ton of interests, and for the longest time, I didn't know what I wanted to do in the future. <br>
However, in May 2023 (after much debate), I decided to pursue Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo, one of North America's most innovative and top technology schools. :bulb:<br>

![PYTHON, C++, C, SWIFT, TS, JS, HTML, CSS, NEXT, REACT, VUE, VITE, NODE, PYTORCH, FIREBASE, TAILWIND,AWS, GIT, GITHUB, VSCODE](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=py,cpp,c,swift,ts,js,html,css,next,react,vue,vite,nodejs,pytorch,firebase,tailwind,aws,git,github,vscode&perline=4)

## Currently... 
I am currently a Software Developer for [Dandelion Networks](https://www.dandelionnet.com/). <br>
Built the ultimate productivity app: [Time-CoPilot](https://www.time-copilot.com/). <br>

I was also a Firmware Developer for [Waterloo's Formula Electric Design Team](https://github.com/UWaterloo-Formula-Electric). <br>
I have done a few projects recently, including: :hammer_and_wrench:	
- A movie project using Vue, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and Postman, integrating data from the TMDB API. Uses Firebase for Backend: User Authentication, Hosting, and Firestore Database
- Snake game using Python and PyGame 
- Minesweeper game using C++
- A Fall Detection Device for the elderly, using a STM32, C/C++, an MPU6050 accelerometer+gyroscope, and a GSM Module
- Productivity App for the Web, using AWS (Amplify, Cognito, Route53, WorkMail, DynamoDB), NoSQL, Next.js, React.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS <br>

And well, of course, a lot of my time is spent on school related stuff

## What's next?
I am currently working on: :construction_worker:
- Mobile App for iOS and Andriod

And I am always adding more stuff to my personal website. Check it out with the link below!
