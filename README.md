# Hi there :)

## About me 
I'm Allen, a 1A Computer Engineering Student at the University of Waterloo. <br>
I have a ton of interests, and I would be lying if I said I always knew what I wanted to do in the future. <br>
I've always been interested in Software, Hardware, Technology, Space, Business, Management, Sports, History, Medical science and much more. <br>
However, in May 2023 (after much debate), I decided to pursue Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo, one of North America's most innovative and top technology schools. <br>

## Currently... 
I am currently a Firmware Developer for Waterloo's Formula Electric Design Team: https://github.com/UWaterloo-Formula-Electric. <br>
I develop firmware for the vehicle using C, and create and execute HIL tests with Python

I have done a few projects recently, including: 
- A movie project using Vue, JS, HTML/CSS, Axios, and Postman, integrating data from the TMDB API. 
- Python games using Pygame and Python 
- Minesweeper game using C++
- A Fall Detection Device for the elderly, using a STM32, C/C++, an MPU6050 accelerometer+gyroscope, and a GSM Module 

And well, of course, most of my time is spent doing school work

## What's next?
And I am currently working on a Wildlife and Plant Detector, which will use Python, CVAT, PyTorch, Vite.js, React.js, TypeScript, HTML/CSS, and React Native <br>
I am also working on getting my own website up and running, which will be a place to showcase my projects, post helpful resources and tips I have/I've gotten, and a place to blog about my interests, the many things I do outside of school, and just my life. 

This is just the beginning...
