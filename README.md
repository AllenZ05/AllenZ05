# Hi there :)

**Seeking Summer 2024 Co-ops/Internships** :computer:<br>
**Interested in software roles, anywhere in Canada or US** :canada: :us:<br>	
You can message me using the socials (preferably email) I've attached below. Always happy to talk and connect! :smile:

## About me 
I'm Allen, a first year Computer Engineering Student at the University of Waterloo. :school:<br>
I've always had a ton of interests, and for the longest time, I didn't know what I wanted to do in the future. <br>
However, in May 2023 (after much debate), I decided to pursue Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo, one of North America's most innovative and top technology schools. :bulb:<br>

## Currently... 
I am currently a Firmware Developer for [Waterloo's Formula Electric Design Team]( https://github.com/UWaterloo-Formula-Electric). <br>
I develop and test firmware for the vehicle using C, and create and execute HIL tests with Python

I have done a few projects recently, including: :hammer_and_wrench:	
- A movie project using Vue, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and Postman, integrating data from the TMDB API. Uses Firebase for Backend: User Authentication, Hosting, and Firestore Database
- Python games using Python and PyGame 
- Minesweeper game using C++
- A Fall Detection Device for the elderly, using a STM32, C/C++, an MPU6050 accelerometer+gyroscope, and a GSM Module 

And well, of course, a lot of my time is spent on school related stuff

## What's next?
I am currently working on two projects: :construction_worker:
- Wildlife and Plant Detector, using Python, PyTorch<br>
- Productivity App for Web and iOS, using AWS (Amplify, Cognito, Route53, WorkMail, DynamoDB), NoSQL, Next.js, React.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Swift <br>

And I am always adding more stuff to my personal website. Check it out with the link below!
